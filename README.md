## Information

This page contains the materials (slide, code, extra) used during the
Summer School. For general information and official communications see
the page
[replicability.stat.unipd.it](https://replicability.stat.unipd.it/)

## General

The document
[getting-started](extra/getting-started/getting-started.html) contains a
tutorial to install all relevant packages for R and other tools. The
entire folder can be downloaded from
[here](https://github.com/replicability-stat-unipd/replicability-summer-school-2023/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
or can be cloned using `git`.

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:replicability-stat-unipd/replicability-summer-school-2023.git
```

Once downloaded, the project can be opened with `R Studio` simply
opening the `replicability-summer-school-2023.Rproj` file. Then using
the command `devtools::load_all()` all the custom functions within the
`R/` folder can be used.

## Functions

Within slides and exercises we use some custom functions developed for
the workshop. These functions can be loaded with `devtools::load_all()`:

- `R/utils.R`: general utilities for managing the project (not useful
  for the workshop)
- `R/utils-meta.R`: utilities for the meta-analysis workshop
- `R/utils-biostat.R`: utilities for the biostatistic workshop
- `R/utils-replication.R`: utilities for the replication methods
  workshop

## Slides

The slides are located into the specific folders. Then when relevant
`script/` and `objects/` folders contains extra documents and files
included in the slides. The dataset used in the slides are contained
also into the `data` folder and datasets can be accessed also using the
`data()` function.
